# Xhuma: CODE Berlin Challenge Submission
Submission of Application Challenge for CODE University of Applied Sciences 2019

## Getting Started
Please find the site files in the folder 'site'. A live preview of the site is available on [my website](http://jameshiltonbarber.com/xhuma "Xhuma - A network for everyone, everywhere").

Unfortunately, I was not able to finish a complete prototype in the given time frame, but have included the parts I worked on in the folder 'prototype':
- Custom class implementation of MultipeerConnectivity for iOS in the file MultipeerConnection.swift file
- Interface Builder files in complete project (xcode.zip)

With regard to the brief, all information about how and why I chose this project is available at http://jameshiltonbarber.com/xhuma/about/. 

Research and implementation around technical aspects of the challenge can be found at http://jameshiltonbarber.com/xhuma/technology/.
